[Curso CPP Moderno](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEtcGQaT56ch7CfcboVPyN1Klnh7LwaRq)

- C++ Moderno / C++ 11.
- New version every 3 years.
- A simple and direct mapping to hardware.
- Zero-overhead adstraction mechanisms.

- C++ is object-oriented and strongly typed.
- All objects in C++ must have

### C++ Dataypes

- Built-in / Primitive
  - Integer
    - int
    - char
  - Floating
    - float
    - double
  - Void
- Derived
  - Array
  - Pointers
  - References
- User-Defined
  - Structures
  - Unions
  - Clases
  - Enumerations

```
struct Book {
    char title;
    char author;
    char subject;
}
```

POD Classes (Plain Old Data)

- Data containers, they do not have functions.
- Struct sets its members as public by default.

Encapsulation

- Data
- Functions

- Access Control
  - Public
  - Private
  - Protected

### Classes

- Data -> Variables
- Actions -> Methods
- Permissions -> Access controls

Constructors and Destructors

- Special methods declared without a return type and with the same name as the class.
- Object initialization
- Enforces class invariants.
- The destructor is executed automatically and is invoked with the ~

### Pointers

- Low-level objects
- Type of data stored
- Assigned memory address
- Unary address operator &
- Unary dereference operator \*
- Arrow operator ->
  - Dereferences the pointer, like the \* operator
  - Accesses the member of the pointed object that we specify.

### References

- A reference is declared using the &
- We cannot create NULL references.
- Once a reference is initialized, it cannot be changed to refer to another object.
- A reference must be initialized when it
